emacs is a text editor. Now I use it for everything.

### Preface
When I just got into graduate school, I knew nothing about linux. I
never used command line tools before. When my advisor first introduce
to me how to use emacs as an latex editor, I saw it as an opportunity
for me to start working like a coder.

The beginning is awkward. I have a laptop and a PC, both with
Windows. There is a small work station in my office and a campus
cluster server, both with linux. So I used ssh to log into the severs
and play with the shell terminal. After these were connected, I have
to get used to the key binding of emacs, and learn how to config
Xserver for graphics. This take a while, and I finnaly mastering it,
especially after I switch to a MacBook Air as my working laptop. The
mac system is based on linux. So I had everything install in the Mac
and only run programs in the server.
