A page redirect to [OpenSourceWuhan](https://weileizeng.github.io/OpenSourceWuhan/)

* this site  https://weileizeng.github.io/OpenSourceCOVID-19/
* destination site https://weileizeng.github.io/OpenSourceWuhan/

Since WHO change the official name to COVID-19, it will be easier to add this key word.
