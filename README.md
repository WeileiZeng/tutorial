## Introduction

I enjoy discussion on education and practice some of my ideas by tutoring. Since high school, I started tutoring on Math, Physics, and sometimes English. Recently my interest turn to programming. Here is a list of the subject I would like to or used to teach. This repository also contains materials for those classes where I work as a teaching assistant.
