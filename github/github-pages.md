## How to host a website on github?

It is easy! Go through this [sample](https://github.dev/) Your website will be on in minutes. Then play with it.

You will probably learn a little bit about jekyll, Liquid, html, css, javascript, yaml, json, etc. However,  it is already wrappered very well in those templates, and you only need to edit markdown files for your pages or posts!
